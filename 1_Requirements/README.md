INTRODUCTION:
----------------------
The Ultrasonic Sensor is arguably the most common distance measuring sensor, also known as the Sonar sensor. It detects the distance to objects by emitting high-frequency sound waves.It sends an ultrasonic pulse out at 40kHz which travels through the air and if there is an obstacle or object, it will bounce back to the sensor. By calculating the travel time and the speed of sound, the distance can be calculated. Ultrasonic sensors are a great solution for the detection of clear objects.Ultrasonic sensors work by emitting sound waves at a frequency too high for humans to hear. They then wait for the sound to be reflected back, calculating distance based on the time required. This is similar to how radar measures the time it takes a radio wave to return after hitting an object.Ultrasound is an acoustic wave with a very high frequency, beyond human hearing. Since the audible frequency range is said to be between 20Hz and 20kHz, ultrasound generally means acoustic waves above 20kHz. Ultrasound has several characteristics which make it so useful and that have led to its use in many electronics applications. Firstly, it is inaudible to humans and therefore undetectable by the user. Secondly, ultrasound waves can be produced with high directivity. Thirdly, they are a compressional vibration of matter (usually air). Finally, they have a lower propagation speed than light or radio waves.
Ultrasound travels in the air at around 340m/s like other sounds. The time it takes for an ultrasound wave to travel 10cm is approximately 3ms, as opposed to 3.3ns for light and radio waves. This allows measurement using low speed signal processing.


RESEARCH:
-----------------------
Ultrasonic sensor uses basic principle of sound propagation and reflection by material in the ultrasonic frequency range. By applying this principle, ultrasonic sensors can still function well in conditions where light intensity is low or dark. Ultrasonic sensor also have several advantages over camera such as smaller size, relatively cheaper price, easier to be implemented, and lower power consumption.Parking sensors use a type of sonar. The term sonar is an acronym for sound navigation and radar; it's used for calculating the distance and/or direction of an object from the time it takes for a sound wave to travel to the target and back. An ultrasonic sensor is a speaker or microphone that emits or receives ultrasound. There is also a type that can handle both emission and reception. Vehicle parking sensors are equipped with this type of sensor.This system controls steering, acceleration and braking automatically, based on the parking zone and location information gained from the ultrasonic sensor, to achieve parallel parking and garage parking.In the case of the rear sonar, ultrasonic sensors are mounted on the rear bumper to detect an obstacle up to 2 to 2.5m away. The distance is communicated to the driver in real time using varying buzzer sounds. Even a wire fence can be detected if it is close enough.The main characteristics of ultrasonic sensors for rear sonar are directivity, ringing time, sensitivity and sound pressure.Directivity of an ultrasonic sensor corresponds to the size and shape of the vibrating surface (that is emitting the ultrasound) and the frequency at which it vibrates.
